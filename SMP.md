# **Software Management Plans**

An SMP is a document that describes how a specific software project is **developed**, **maintained**, and **curated**. The goal of an SMP is to ensure that the software is usable and **maintainable** in the long term.

# **Definition of Research software**

Research Software includes source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational
workflows and executables that were created during the research process
or for a research purpose. 

*Software components (e.g., operating systems, libraries, dependencies, packages, scripts, etc.) that are used for research but were not created during or with a clear research intent should be considered software in research and not Research Software.*

# Why are SMP's useful?

An SMP makes explicit what research software does, who it is for, what the outputs are, who is responsible for the release and ensures that the software stays available to the community (and for how long).

## Low management level

**Purpose**
Specific analysis (e.g. plotting a graph) or one-off project. Developer is the primary user, not intended to be used beyong a defined period.

**Reliability**
Few lines of code with an output that can be tested visually or basic input/output testing.

**Maintenance**
Due to small scope, no additional maintentenance planning required.

---

## Medium management level

**Purpose**
Research project or primary research output. May be used by others.

**Reliability**



**Maintenance**

---

## High management level

**Purpose**
Research project or primary research output. May be used by others.

**Reliability**



**Maintenance**
